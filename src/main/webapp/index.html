          <p>
            Friends of Friends is a friend finding app! Simply log in with Facebook,
            and we will look at your friends lists and the friends lists of other users 
            on the app to show you all of the users whom you have a mutual friend with! 
            Click "Friend Me" or "Pass" on those people in order to get your matches. 
            Coronavirus and quarantine has limited social interaction to our immediate 
            social circle, and has made it difficult to meet new friends. Friends of 
            Friends addresses this issue, helping users meet friends online, and by building 
            an added aspect of trust, as you already will be friends with someone who knows 
            your new potential friend.

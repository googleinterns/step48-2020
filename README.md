# Friends of Friends
Friends of Friends is a web-based social platform to help users 'match' with other potential friends, based on their mutual Facebook connections.
* The user logs in with their Facebook account, creates a profile, and can either 'friend' or 'pass' on potential friends.
* The user feed consists of potential matches (i.e people who the user has a common friend with)
* The matches page display all of a user’s matches (i.e the people who they wanted to friend who also wanted to friend them)

Coronavirus and quarantine has limited social interaction to our immediate social circle, and has made it difficult to meet new friends. Our application safely addresses this issue, helping users meet friends online, and by giving user’s something to talk about comfortably (their mutual friend).

[Alisha Kewalramani](https://github.com/alikew24), [Jess DeJong](https://github.com/jessdejong), and [Isabelle Dittamo](https://github.com/mivdittamo) worked on this project as part of pod #48. [Nik Estep](https://github.com/estep-google) and [Daniel Tomasiewicz](https://github.com/daniel-google) were our managers.
